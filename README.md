# School District Analysis
## Overview of the Project: An analysis of a local school district based of test scores, school spending, school size and school type.

This project asked me to examine a local school district's test performance after evidence of possible academic dishonesty by one grade of a particular school. I was asked to evaluate the original performance statistics as well as the revised statistics with those scores removed to get a more clear picture of the school district statistics.  

Specifically, I removed all the 9th grade test scores from Thomas High School, where there was evidence of possible cheating going on. The scores for those students were made null, so the statistics would be omitted from the final revised calculations. 

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?
The district summary was affected by higher overall test scores.

#### % Passing Math
- Original percentage of 73.9% 
- Revised percentage of 74.8%

#### % Passing Reading
- Original percentage of 84.7%
- Revised percentage of 85.7%

#### % Overall Passing
- Original percentage of 64.1%
- Revised percentage of 64.9%

Removing those instances of cheating showed that the students that were not cheating were performing better. Maybe the moral of the story is, cheaters never prosper. 

### How is the school summary affected?
Thomas High School scores rose significantly when you removed the 9th grade scores.

#### % Passing Math
- Original percentage of 66.91%
- Revised percentage of 93.19%
- Over 26% increase with the 9th graders removed is huge! This shows how that the rest of the school is really doing well on math and 9th graders were significantly bringing down the over math scores. 

#### % Passing Reading
-Original percentage of 69.66%
-Revised percentage of 97.02%
- Similar to the math results, there is an over 27% increase in percentage passing. This is showing that the students are testing really well on reading.

#### % Overall Passing
-Original percentage of 65.08%
-Revised percentage of 90.63%
- The overall passing percentage is similar to the previously mentioned statistics in that the overall passing % increased by over 25% with the 9th grade scores removed. 

Thomas High School seems to be doing things right in terms of test preparation for the 10-12th grade students.

### How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?

#### Thomas High School math scores
In the original data, Thomas High school was on the lower end of the rankings for % passing math. Over half of the schools seem to hit in the high 60's, where the other half of the schools score in the 90's. 

In the revised data, Thomas High School moves up with the schools ranking in the 90's. This shows that removing the 9th grade scores significantly changed the data for them. 

#### Thomas High School reading scores
In the original data, Thomas High School had the lowest % of students passing reading at 69.67%.

Once the 9th grade scores were removed, they moved up to 97.01%, making them the 3rd highest % Passing Reading. 

#### Thomas High School overall scores
In the original data, Thomas High School sits in the middle at 65.07% overall passing. 

In the revised data, they move up to 90.58% passing. The 9th grade scores were significantly bringing them down.
